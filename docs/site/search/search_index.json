The API provides basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) through RESTful endpoints. What This Project Does This FastAPI-based application provides a simple calculator service with the following endpoints: /calc/add - Adds two numbers /calc/sub - Subtracts the second number from the first /calc/mul - Multiplies two numbers /calc/div - Divides the first number by the second /health - Health check endpoint All calculator endpoints accept POST requests with JSON body containing two numerical values ( a and b ). Running the Application Running Locally Ensure you have Python 3.10 or newer installed Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt Run the application: python app/main.py Access the API at http://localhost:4444 For API documentation, visit http://localhost:4444/docs Running with Docker Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed Build and run the container: docker-compose up Access the API at http://localhost:2222 For API documentation, visit http://localhost:2222/docs Configuration The application uses environment variables for configuration following 12 Factor principles: PORT - The port on which the application runs (default: 4444) LOG_LEVEL - Logging level (default: \"info\") REDIS_URL - Redis connection URL if needed (default: \"None\") You can create a .env file in the root directory with these variables to configure the application.
